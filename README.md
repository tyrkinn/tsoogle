# Tsoogle Prototype

[Hoogle](https://hoogle.haskell.org/) like code exploration CLI for Typescript

Developed with Golang, [Treesitter](https://github.com/tree-sitter/tree-sitter) and [Levenshtein Distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levenshtein_distance)

Hugely inspired by [Tsoding](https://github.com/tsoding) and his [Coogle](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wK1HjnwDQng&t=1s) project

Now project in early stage of development so there are a lot of bugs there
